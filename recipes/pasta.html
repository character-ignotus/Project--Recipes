        <h3>Description of recipe:</h3>
        <p>Roasting enhances the flavors of any vegetable, but seems to add a wonderful, rich sweetness when done with cherry tomatoes. 
        This recipe takes that sweetness, complements it with fresh herbs and a touch of heat from red pepper flakes, with some low-fat 
        ricotta to smooth it all out. I topped it with some salty, nutty Pecorino cheese.</p>
